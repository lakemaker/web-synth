<h2>Wavetable synthesizerëž€?</h2>

<p>
<strong>Wavetable</strong> synthesis is a sound synthesis technique used to create periodic waveforms. Often used in the production of musical tones or notes, it was first written about by Hal Chamberlin in Byte's September 1977 issue.[1] Wolfgang Palm of Palm Products GmbH (PPG) developed it in the late 1970s[2] and published in 1979.[3] The technique has since been used as the primary synthesis method in synthesizers built by PPG and Waldorf Music and as an auxiliary synthesis method by Ensoniq and Access. It is currently used in hardware synthesizers from Waldorf Music and in software-based synthesizers for PCs and tablets, including apps offered by PPG and Waldorf, among others.

It was also independently developed in a similar time frame by Michael McNabb, who used it in his 1978 composition Dreamsong.
